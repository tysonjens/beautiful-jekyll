In 2014, while working for a predictive analytics startup called Custora I was introduced to coding through R. The data scientists there were incredibly gracious and took time to teach me about several machine learning algorithms we employed in our tool.

Since then I've continued to study R, Python, and machine learning through MOOCs and bootcamps. I'm interested in applying the tools in value-based healthcare provider settings.

I live in Denver, CO, with my wife, Kelli, and my two children, Alpha and Boone.

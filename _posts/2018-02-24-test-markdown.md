title: Galvanize Data Immersive - First Days
subtitle:
tags: [galvanize]
---

Week one of my 12-week data science program with Galvanize is officially in the books. Going in I had two main concerns:
* [Big] will I be able to keep up with all the "real" coders as we dive into Python?
* [Small] will this be challenging enough?

Big take away: aspiring data scientists come from so many different backgrounds that everyone in the class (myself included) felt comfortable at times and very uncomfortable at times. Overall I've been extremely impressed with the others in my class - and have had several opportunities to learn from them, and few opportunities when I could contribute as well.

The first week was focused on learning the **tools** of data science. Topics included:

Thing    | What it's good for
---------|--------------------
Command Line | Navigating your computer and running programs
Git  | Version control for coders. How to code in teams
Unit test | Coding with the end in mind - testing your
Python | Where the magic happens - classes and objects
PostgresQL | How data is stored, and how to query it
Psycopg2 | Querying data from a python python_script
Mongodb | How to store less structured data in a structured way :-)
Pymongo | Querying data from python

### What can I use at DMG?

Until now my typical workflow on a data project has been to dump data from SQL into a csv, upload it to R or Python to do all the cleaning, do some modeling, and then spit out clean data to excel or Tableau.

I learned A TON about SQL this week, so I can now pull *just the data I need* directly from a Python script. What's more, I could share that code with others in the business via github, and build code together using git. Finally, while I had learned Python for working with data, I made good strides toward being a believable coder - meaning that data projects I build going forward will better interface with our data warehouses / data teams.

### Typical Day

* 08:30 - arrive and download lectures/data sets from Github
* 09:30 - Morning lecture begins
* 11:00 - Begin individual assignment
* 13:30 - Quick bite
* 14:00 - LECTURE
* 16:00 - begin pair programming assignments
* 18:30 - finish pair programming, head home
* 21:00 - write notes for the day, do pre-reading for following day

### Next Week

We begin a more conceptual dive into statistics and Python structures useful for data, like Python Pandas.

Week two of my 12-week data science program with Galvanize is over. The focus this week was on statistics - and we flew through common distributions and how to model real-life events with them using scipy, a module for Python.  

We also studied several methods for hypothesis testing - including frequentist methods like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian methods like Maximum A Posteriori (MAP). One test that was new to me was the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test**, which tests whether two sets of random variables are drawn from the same distribution.

For example - oil pipeline accidents occur in the US at an average rate of 32 accidents per month, but there are some months when very few occur and others when more occur. Between 2010 and 2017, the distribution looked like:

### What can I use at DMG?



### Next Week

With coding and statistics foundations behind us, we'll be studying several machine learning modules.
